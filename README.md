A simple data analysis project exploring COVID-19 trends in Egypt using Python. The project uses Jupyter Notebook to process and visualize key metrics such as total confirmed cases, total deaths, daily new cases, and calculates important indicators like growth rates and case fatality rates. Additionally, it employs time series forecasting with Facebook Prophet to predict future trends of the pandemic.

The goal is to offer valuable insights into the progression of COVID-19 in Egypt, helping researchers, policymakers, and the public understand the impact and anticipate upcoming developments.

All data processing, visualization, and forecasting are documented step-by-step within the Jupyter Notebook.
